ii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In compiling the following History from the Archives of 
Pantouflia, the Editor has incurred several obligations to the 
Learned.&nbsp; The Return of Benson (chapter xii.) is the fruit 
of the research of the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Allen 
Quatermain</span>, while the final <i>wish</i> of Prince Prigio 
was suggested by the invention or erudition of a Lady.</p>
<p>A study of the <i>Firedrake</i> in South Africa&mdash;where he
is called the <i>Nanaboul&eacute;l&eacute;</i>, a difficult 
word&mdash;has been published in French (translated from the 
Basuto language) by M. <span class="smcap">Paul 
S&eacute;billot</span>, in the <i>Revue des Traditione 
Populaires</i>.&nbsp; For the <i>Remora</i>, the Editor is 
indebted to the <i>Voyage &agrave; la Lune</i> of M. <span 
class="smcap">Cyrano de Berg&eacute;rac</span>.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>How the Fairies were not Invited to Court</i>.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there reigned in Pantouflia a king and a 
queen.&nbsp; With almost everything else to make them happy, they
wanted one thing: they had no children.&nbsp; This vexed the king
even more than the queen, who was very clever and learned, and 
who had hated <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>dolls when she was a child.&nbsp; 
However, she, too in spite of all the books she read and all the 
pictures she painted, would have been glad enough to be the 
mother of a little prince.&nbsp; The king was anxious to consult 
the fairies, but the queen would not hear of such a thing.&nbsp; 
She did not believe in fairies: she said that they had never 
existed; and that she maintained, though <i>The History of the 
Royal Family</i> was full of chapters about nothing else.</p>
<p>Well, at long and at last they had a little boy, who was 
generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been 
seen.&nbsp; Even her majesty herself remarked that, though she 
could never believe all the courtiers told her, yet he certainly 
was a fine child&mdash;a very fine child.</p>
<p>Now, the time drew near for the christening party, and the 
king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour 
talking over <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>it.&nbsp; It was a splendid room, hung
with portraits of the royal ancestors.&nbsp; There was 
Cinderella, the grandmother of the reigning monarch, with her 
little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her.&nbsp; 
There was the Marquis de Carabas, who, as everyone knows, was 
raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with 
the daughter of the king of the period.&nbsp; On the arm of the 
throne was seated his celebrated cat, wearing boots.&nbsp; There,
too, was a portrait of a beautiful lady, sound asleep: this was 
Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant, also an ancestress of the royal 
family.&nbsp; Many other pictures of celebrated persons were 
hanging on the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have asked all the right people, my dear?&rdquo; 
said the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone who should be asked,&rdquo; answered the 
queen.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>&ldquo;People are so touchy on these occasions,&rdquo; 
said his majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have not forgotten any of our 
aunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the old cats!&rdquo; replied the queen; for the 
king&rsquo;s aunts were old-fashioned, and did not approve of 
her, and she knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very kind old ladies in their way,&rdquo; said
the king; &ldquo;and were nice to me when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he waited a little, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fairies, of course, you have invited?&nbsp; It has 
always been usual, in our family, on an occasion like this; and I
think we have neglected them a little of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>can</i> you be so <i>absurd</i>?&rdquo; cried 
the queen.&nbsp; &ldquo;How often must I tell you that there are 
<i>no</i> fairies?&nbsp; And even if there were&mdash;but, no 
matter; pray let us drop the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very old friends of our family, my <!-- page 
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>dear, 
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the king timidly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Often and often they have been godmothers to us.&nbsp; 
One, in particular, was most kind and most serviceable to 
Cinderella I., my own grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother!&rdquo; interrupted her majesty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee!&nbsp; If anyone puts such nonsense into the
head of my little Prigio&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here the baby was brought in by the nurse, and the queen 
almost devoured it with kisses.&nbsp; And so the fairies were not
invited!&nbsp; It was an extraordinary thing, but none of the 
nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that
the fairies had not been asked.&nbsp; Some were abroad; several 
were ill; a few were in prison among the Saracens; others were 
captives in the dens of ogres.&nbsp; The end of it was that the 
king and queen had to sit down alone, one at each end of a very 
long table, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>arrayed with plates and glasses for a 
hundred guests&mdash;for a hundred guests who never came!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any soup, my dear?&rdquo; shouted the king, through a 
speaking-trumpet; when, suddenly, the air was filled with a sound
like the rustling of the wings of birds.</p>
<p><i>Flitter</i>, <i>flitter</i>, <i>flutter</i>, went the 
noise; and when the queen looked up, lo and behold! on every seat
was a lovely fairy, dressed in green, each with a <i>most 
interesting-looking parcel</i> in her hand.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
like opening parcels?&nbsp; The king did, and he was most 
friendly and polite to the fairies.&nbsp; But the queen, though 
she saw them distinctly, took no notice of them.&nbsp; You see, 
she did not believe in fairies, nor in her own eyes, when she saw
them.&nbsp; So she talked across the fairies to the king, just as
if they had not been there; but the king behaved as <!-- page 
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>politely
as if they were <i>real</i>&mdash;which, of course, they 
were.</p>
<p>When dinner was over, and when the nurse had brought in the 
baby, all the fairies gave him the most magnificent 
presents.&nbsp; One offered a purse which could never be empty; 
and one a pair of seven-leagued boots; and another a cap of 
darkness, that nobody might see the prince when he put it on; and
another a wishing-cap; and another a carpet, on which, when he 
sat, he was carried wherever he wished to find himself.&nbsp; 
Another made him beautiful for ever; and another, brave; and 
another, lucky: but the last fairy of all, a cross old thing, 
crept up and said, &ldquo;My child, you shall be <i>too</i> 
clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fairy&rsquo;s gift would have pleased the queen, if she 
had believed in it, more than anything else, because she was so 
clever herself.&nbsp; But <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>she took no notice at all; and the 
fairies went each to her own country, and none of them stayed 
there at the palace, where nobody believed in them, except the 
king, a little.&nbsp; But the queen tossed all their nice boots 
and caps, carpets, purses, swords, and all, away into a dark 
lumber-room; for, of course, she thought that they were <i>all 
nonsense</i>, and merely old rubbish out of books, or pantomime 
&ldquo;properties.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>Prince Prigio and his Family</i>.</p>
<p>Well, the little prince grew up.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ve told
you that his name was Prigio&mdash;did I not?&nbsp; Well, that 
<i>was</i> his name.&nbsp; You cannot think how clever he 
was.&nbsp; He argued with his nurse as soon as he could speak, 
which was very soon.&nbsp; He argued that he did not like to be 
washed, because <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the soap got into his eyes.&nbsp; 
However, when he was told all about the <i>pores of the skin</i>,
and how they could not be healthy if he was not washed, he at 
once ceased to resist, for he was very reasonable.&nbsp; He 
argued with his father that he did not see why there should be 
kings who were rich, while beggars were poor; and why the 
king&mdash;who was a little greedy&mdash;should have poached eggs
and plum-cake at afternoon tea, while many other persons went 
without dinner.&nbsp; The king was so surprised and hurt at these
remarks that he boxed the prince&rsquo;s ears, saying, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to be too clever, my lad.&rdquo; Then
he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy, and was sorry 
for the rudeness of the queen.&nbsp; And when the prince, after 
having his ears boxed, said that &ldquo;force was no 
argument,&rdquo; the king went away in a rage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p11.jpg">
<img alt="Prigio reading a book" src="images/p11.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Indeed, I cannot tell you how the prince <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>was hated by 
all!&nbsp; He would go down into the kitchen, and show the cook 
how to make soup.&nbsp; He would visit the poor people&rsquo;s 
cottage, and teach them how to make the beds, and how to make 
plum-pudding out of turnip-tops, and venison cutlets out of rusty
bacon.&nbsp; He showed the fencing-master how to fence, and the 
professional cricketer how to bowl, and <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>instructed 
the rat-catcher in breeding terriers.&nbsp; He set sums to the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and assured the Astronomer Royal 
that the sun does not go round the earth&mdash;which, for my 
part, I believe it does.&nbsp; The young ladies of the Court 
disliked dancing with him, in spite of his good looks, because he
was always asking, &ldquo;Have you read this?&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Have you read that?&rdquo;&mdash;and when they said they 
hadn&rsquo;t, he sneered; and when they said they <i>had</i>, he 
found them out.</p>
<p>He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid 
way; correcting the accent of his French teacher, and trying to 
get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife.&nbsp; He 
also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager, his grandmother, an 
art with which she had long been perfectly familiar!&nbsp; In 
fact, he knew everything better than anybody else; and the <!-- 
page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>worst of it was that he <i>did</i>: and he was never in 
the wrong, and he always said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you 
so?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, what was more, he <i>had</i>!</p>
<p>As time went on, Prince Prigio had two younger brothers, whom 
everybody liked.&nbsp; They were not a bit clever, but 
jolly.&nbsp; Prince Alphonso, the third son, was round, fat, 
good-humoured, and as brave as a lion.&nbsp; Prince Enrico, the 
second, was tall, thin, and a little sad, but <i>never</i> too 
clever.&nbsp; Both were in love with two of their own cousins 
(with the approval of their dear parents); and all the world 
said, &ldquo;What nice, unaffected princes they are!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too 
clever for the foreign ambassadors.&nbsp; Now, as Pantouflia was 
a rich, lazy country, which hated fighting, this was very 
unpleasant, and did not make people love Prince Prigio any 
better.</p>
<h2><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><i>About the Firedrake</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the people who did not like Prigio, his own dear papa, 
King Grognio, disliked him most.&nbsp; For the king knew he was 
not clever, himself.&nbsp; When he was in the counting-house, 
counting out his money, and when he happened to say, 
&ldquo;Sixteen shillings and fourteen and twopence are three 
pounds, fifteen,&rdquo; it made him wild to hear Prigio whisper, 
&ldquo;One pound, ten and twopence&rdquo;&mdash;which, of course,
it <i>is</i>.&nbsp; And the king was afraid that Prigio would 
conspire, and get made king himself&mdash;which was the last 
thing Prigio really wanted.&nbsp; He much preferred to <!-- page 
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>idle 
about, and know everything without seeming to take any 
trouble.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p15b.jpg">
<img alt="The King at his desk" src="images/p15s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Well, the king thought and thought.&nbsp; How was he to get 
Prigio out of the way, and make Enrico or Alphonso his 
successor?&nbsp; He read in books about it; and all the books 
showed that, if a king sent his three sons to do anything, <!-- 
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>it was always the youngest who did it, and got the 
crown.&nbsp; And he wished he had the chance.&nbsp; Well, it 
arrived at last.</p>
<p>There was a very hot summer!&nbsp; It began to be hot in 
March.&nbsp; All the rivers were dried up.&nbsp; The grass did 
not grow.&nbsp; The corn did not grow.&nbsp; The thermometers 
exploded with heat.&nbsp; The barometers stood at <span 
class="smcap">Set Fair</span>.&nbsp; The people were much 
distressed, and came and broke the palace windows&mdash;as they 
usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia.</p>
<p>The king consulted the learned men about the Court, who told 
him that probably a</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span 
class="smcap">Firedrake</span></p>
<p>was in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Now, the Firedrake is a beast, or bird, about the bigness of 
an elephant.&nbsp; Its body is made of iron, and it is always 
red-hot.&nbsp; A more terrible <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and cruel 
beast cannot be imagined; for, if you go near it, you are at once
broiled by the Firedrake.</p>
<p>But the king was not ill-pleased: &ldquo;for,&rdquo; thought 
he, &ldquo;of course my three sons must go after the brute, the 
eldest first; and, as usual, it will kill the first two, and be 
beaten by the youngest.&nbsp; It is a little hard on Enrico, poor
boy; but <i>anything</i> to get rid of that Prigio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king went to Prigio, and said that his country was in
danger, and that he was determined to leave the crown to 
whichever of them would bring him the horns (for it has horns) 
and tail of the Firedrake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an awkward brute to tackle,&rdquo; the king said,
&ldquo;but you are the oldest, my lad; go where glory waits 
you!&nbsp; Put on your armour, and be off with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p18b.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;Put on your armour and be off with you!&rdquo;" 
src="images/p18s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>This the king said, hoping that either the Firedrake 
would roast Prince Prigio alive (which he could easily do, as I 
have said; for he is all over as hot as a red-hot poker), or 
that, if the prince succeeded, at least his country would be 
freed from the monster.</p>
<p>But the prince, who was lying on the sofa doing sums in 
compound division for fun, said in the politest way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the education your majesty has given me, I 
have learned that the Firedrake, like the siren, the fairy, and 
so forth, is a fabulous animal which does not exist.&nbsp; But 
even granting, for the sake of argument, that there is a 
Firedrake, your majesty is well aware that there is no kind of 
use in sending <i>me</i>.&nbsp; It is always the eldest son who 
goes out first and comes to grief on these occasions, and it is 
always the third son that succeeds.&nbsp; Send <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>Alphonso&rdquo; (this was the youngest brother), 
&ldquo;and <i>he</i> will do the trick at once.&nbsp; At least, 
if he fails, it will be most unusual, and Enrico can try his 
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate, and the 
king had to send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico.&nbsp; 
They both came in very warm; for they had been whipping tops, and
the day was unusually hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;just you two 
younger ones look at Prigio!&nbsp; You see how hot it is, and how
coolly he takes it, and the country suffering; and all on account
of a Firedrake, you know, which has apparently built his nest not
far off.&nbsp; Well, I have asked that lout of a brother of yours
to kill it, and he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he does not believe in Firedrakes,&rdquo; 
interrupted Prigio.&nbsp; &ldquo;The weather&rsquo;s warm enough 
without going out hunting!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>&ldquo;Not believe in Firedrakes!&rdquo; cried 
Alphonso.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder what you <i>do</i> believe 
in!&nbsp; Just let me get at the creature!&rdquo; for he was as 
brave as a lion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi!&nbsp; Page, my chain-armour, 
helmet, lance, and buckler!&nbsp; <i>A Molinda</i>!&nbsp; <i>A 
Molinda</i>!&rdquo; which was his <i>war-cry</i>.</p>
<p>The page ran to get the armour; but it was so <i>uncommonly 
hot</i> that he dropped it, and put his fingers in his mouth, 
crying!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p21.jpg">
<img alt="The page crying" src="images/p21.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better put on flannels, Alphonso, for this kind
of work,&rdquo; said Prigio.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I were you, 
I&rsquo;d take a light garden-engine, full of water, to squirt at
the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy thought!&rdquo; said Alphonso.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
will!&rdquo;&nbsp; And off he went, kissed his dear Molinda, bade
her keep a lot of dances for him (there was to <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>be a dance 
when he had killed the Firedrake), and then he rushed to the 
field!</p>
<p>But he never came back any more!</p>
<p>Everyone wept bitterly&mdash;everyone but Prince Prigio; for 
he thought it was a practical joke, and said that Alphonso had 
taken the opportunity to start off on his travels and see the 
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some dreadful mistake, sir,&rdquo; said Prigio
to the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know as well as I do that the 
youngest son has always succeeded, up to now.&nbsp; But I 
entertain great hopes of Enrico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he grinned; for he fancied it was all <i>nonsense</i>, and
that there were no Firedrakes.</p>
<p>Enrico was present when Prigio was consoling the king in this 
unfeeling way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enrico, my boy,&rdquo; said his majesty, &ldquo;the 
task awaits you, and the honour.&nbsp; When <i>you</i> <!-- page 
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>come 
back with the horns and tail of the Firedrake, you shall be crown
prince; and Prigio shall be made an usher at the Grammar 
School&mdash;it is all he is fit for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enrico was not quite so confident as Alphonso had been.&nbsp; 
He insisted on making his will; and he wrote a poem about the 
pleasures and advantages of dying young.&nbsp; This is part of 
it:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The violet is a blossom sweet</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>That droops before the day is done</i>&mdash;<br 
/>
<i>Slain by thine overpowering heat</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>O Sun</i>!</p>
<p><i>And I</i>, <i>like that sweet purple flower</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>May roast</i>, <i>or boil</i>, <i>or broil</i>, 
<i>or bake</i>,<br />
<i>If burned by thy terrific power</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Firedrake</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem comforted Enrico more or less, and he showed it to 
Prigio.&nbsp; But the prince only laughed, and said that the 
second line of <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the last verse was not very good; for
violets do not &ldquo;roast, or boil, or broil, or 
bake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enrico tried to improve it, but could not.&nbsp; So he read it
to his cousin, Lady Kathleena, just as it was; and she cried over
it (though I don&rsquo;t think she understood it); and Enrico 
cried a little, too.</p>
<p>However, next day he started, with a spear, a patent 
refrigerator, and a lot of the bottles people throw at fires to 
put them out.</p>
<p>But <i>he</i> never came back again!</p>
<p>After shedding torrents of tears, the king summoned Prince 
Prigio to his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dastard!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poltroon!&nbsp; 
<i>Your</i> turn, which should have come first, has arrived at 
last.&nbsp; <i>You</i> must fetch me the horns and the tail of 
the Firedrake.&nbsp; Probably you will be grilled, thank 
goodness; but who will give me back Enrico and 
Alphonso?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>&ldquo;Indeed, your majesty,&rdquo; said Prigio, 
&ldquo;you must permit me to correct your policy.&nbsp; Your only
reason for dispatching your sons in pursuit of this dangerous but
I believe <i>fabulous</i> animal, was to ascertain which of us 
would most worthily succeed to your throne, at the 
date&mdash;long may it be deferred!&mdash;of your lamented 
decease.&nbsp; Now, there can be no further question about the 
matter.&nbsp; I, unworthy as I am, represent the sole hope of the
royal family.&nbsp; Therefore to send me after the Firedrake were
<a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25" 
class="citation">[25]</a> both dangerous and unnecessary.&nbsp; 
Dangerous, because, if he treats me as you say he did my 
brothers&mdash;my unhappy brothers,&mdash;the throne of 
Pantouflia will want an heir.&nbsp; But, if I do come back 
alive&mdash;why, I cannot be more the true heir than I am at 
present; now <i>can</i> I?&nbsp; Ask the Lord Chief Justice, if 
you don&rsquo;t believe <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These arguments were so clearly and undeniably correct that 
the king, unable to answer them, withdrew into a solitary place 
where he could express himself with freedom, and give rein to his
expression.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><i>How Prince Prigio was Deserted by Everybody</i>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prince Prigio had to suffer many unpleasant 
things.&nbsp; Though he was the crown prince (and though his 
arguments were unanswerable), everybody shunned him for a 
coward.&nbsp; The queen, who did not believe in Firedrakes, alone
took his side.&nbsp; He was not only avoided by all, but he had 
most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins, Lady Molinda and 
Lady Kathleena.&nbsp; In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking 
alone, and did not bow to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Molly,&rdquo; said the prince, who liked <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>her, 
&ldquo;how have I been so unfortunate as to offend 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name, sir, is Lady Molinda,&rdquo; she said, very 
proudly; &ldquo;and you have sent your own brother to his 
grave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I am 
certain he has merely gone off on his travels.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll 
come back when he&rsquo;s tired: there <i>are</i> no Firedrakes; 
a French writer says they are &lsquo;purement fabuleux,&rsquo; 
purely fabulous, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p29b.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;My name, sir, is Lady Molinda, she said.&rdquo;"
src="images/p29s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Alphonso has gone on his travels, and will come 
back when he is tired!&nbsp; And was he then&mdash;tired&mdash;of
<i>me</i>?&rdquo; cried poor Molinda, bursting into tears, and 
forgetting her dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I beg your pardon, I never noticed; I&rsquo;m
sure I am very sorry,&rdquo; cried the prince, who, never having 
been in love himself, never thought of other people.&nbsp; And he
tried to take <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Molinda&rsquo;s hand, but she 
snatched it from him and ran away through the garden to the 
palace, leaving Prince Prigio to feel foolish, for once, and 
ashamed.</p>
<p>As for Lady Kathleena, she swept past him like a queen, 
without a word.&nbsp; So the prince, for all his cleverness, was 
not happy.</p>
<p>After several days had gone by, the king returned from the 
solitary place where he had been speaking his mind.&nbsp; He now 
felt calmer and better; and so at last he came back to the 
palace.&nbsp; But on seeing Prince Prigio, who was lolling in a 
hammock, translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry for 
his mother, the king broke out afresh, and made use of the most 
cruel and impolite expressions.</p>
<p>At last, he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and 
move to a distant city; and that Prince Prigio should be left 
alone in the <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>palace by himself.&nbsp; For he was 
quite unendurable, the king said, and he could not trust his own 
temper when he thought of him.&nbsp; And he grew so fierce, that 
even the queen was afraid of him now.</p>
<p>The poor queen cried a good deal; Prigio being her favourite 
son, on account of his acknowledged ability and talent.&nbsp; But
the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio
behind.&nbsp; For his part, he, very good-naturedly, showed them 
the best and shortest road to Falkenstein, the city where they 
were going; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary 
for geography, nor the general of the army, knew anything about 
the matter&mdash;which, indeed, they did not.</p>
<p>The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells, for
they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one 
day.&nbsp; He <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>therefore reminded them of this 
little fact in future history, which made them feel uncomfortable
enough, and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep.</p>
<p>When he wakened, the air was cold and the day was beginning to
grow dark.&nbsp; Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine 
at a tavern in the town, for no servants had been left with 
him.&nbsp; But what was his annoyance when he found that his 
boots, his sword, his cap, his cloak&mdash;all his clothes, in 
fact, except those he wore,&mdash;had been taken away by the 
courtiers, merely to spite him!&nbsp; His wardrobe had been 
ransacked, and everything that had not been carried off had been 
cut up, burned, and destroyed.&nbsp; Never was such a spectacle 
of wicked mischief.&nbsp; It was as if hay had been made of 
everything he possessed.&nbsp; What was worse, he had not a penny
in his pocket to buy <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>new things; and his father had 
stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month.</p>
<p>Can you imagine anything more cruel and <i>unjust</i> than 
this conduct? for it was not the prince&rsquo;s fault that he was
so clever.&nbsp; The cruel fairy had made him so.&nbsp; But, even
if the prince had been born clever (as may have happened to you),
was he to be blamed for that?&nbsp; The other people were just as
much in fault for being born so stupid; but the world, my dear 
children, can never be induced to remember this.&nbsp; If you are
clever, you will find it best not to let people know it&mdash;if 
you want them to like you.</p>
<p>Well, here was the prince in a pretty plight.&nbsp; Not a 
pound in his pocket, not a pair of boots to wear, not even a cap 
to cover his head from the rain; nothing but cold meat to eat, 
and never a servant to answer the bell.</p>
<h2><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><i>What Prince Prigio found in the Garret</i>.</p>
<p>The prince walked from room to room of the palace; but, unless
he wrapped himself up in a curtain, there was nothing for him to 
wear when he went out in the rain.&nbsp; At last he climbed up a 
turret-stair in the very oldest part of the castle, where he had 
never been before; and at the very top was a little round room, a
kind of garret.&nbsp; The prince pushed in the door with some 
difficulty&mdash;not that it was locked, but the handle was 
rusty, and the wood had swollen with the damp.&nbsp; The room was
very dark; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came 
through a slit of a window, one of those <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>narrow 
windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times.</p>
<p>But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things 
lying on the floor and on the table.&nbsp; There were two caps; 
he put one on&mdash;an old, grey, ugly cap it was, made of 
felt.&nbsp; There was a pair of boots; and he kicked off his 
slippers, and got into <i>them</i>.&nbsp; They were a good deal 
worn, but fitted as if they had been made for him.&nbsp; On the 
table was a purse with just three gold coins&mdash;old ones, 
too&mdash;in it; and this, as you may fancy, the prince was very 
well pleased to put in his pocket.&nbsp; A sword, with a 
sword-belt, he buckled about his waist; and the rest of the 
articles, a regular collection of odds and ends, he left just 
where they were lying.&nbsp; Then he ran downstairs, and walked 
out of the hall door.</p>
<h2><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><i>What Happened to Prince Prigio in Town</i>.</p>
<p>By this time the prince was very hungry.&nbsp; The town was 
just three miles off; but he had such a royal appetite, that he 
did not like to waste it on bad cookery, and the people of the 
royal town were bad cooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were in &lsquo;The Bear,&rsquo; at 
Gluckstein,&rdquo; said he to himself; for he remembered that 
there was a very good cook there.&nbsp; But, then, the town was 
twenty-one leagues away&mdash;sixty-three long miles!</p>
<p>No sooner had the prince said this, and taken just three 
steps, than he found himself at the door of the &ldquo;Bear 
Inn&rdquo; at Gluckstein!</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>&ldquo;This is the most extraordinary dream,&rdquo; said
he to himself; for he was far too clever, of course, to believe 
in seven-league boots.&nbsp; Yet he had a pair on at that very 
moment, and it was they which had carried him in three strides 
from the palace to Gluckstein!</p>
<p>The truth is, that the prince, in looking about the palace for
clothes, had found his way into that very old lumber-room where 
the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever 
mother, who did not believe in them.&nbsp; But this, of course, 
the prince did not know.</p>
<p>Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those
prodigious steps when you say you <i>want</i> to go a long 
distance.&nbsp; Otherwise they would be very 
inconvenient&mdash;when you only want to cross the room, for 
example.&nbsp; Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your
governess?</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>Well, the prince walked into &ldquo;The Bear,&rdquo; and
it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him.&nbsp; 
And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in 
Pantouflia, for everybody had seen it, at least in 
pictures.&nbsp; He was so puzzled by not being attended to as 
usual, that <i>he quite forgot to take off his cap</i>.&nbsp; He 
sat down at the table, however, and shouted 
&ldquo;<i>Kellner</i>!&rdquo; at which all the waiters jumped, 
and looked round in every direction, but nobody came to 
him.&nbsp; At first he thought they were too busy, but presently 
another explanation occurred to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p38.jpg">
<img alt="The waiters" src="images/p38.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>&ldquo;The king,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;has 
threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me, or helps me in 
any way.&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t mean to starve in the midst of
plenty, anyhow; here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the 
room, where a huge roast turkey had just been placed.&nbsp; He 
helped himself to half the breast, some sausages, chestnut 
stuffing, bread sauce, potatoes, and a bottle of red 
wine&mdash;Burgundy.&nbsp; He then went back to a table in a 
corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of 
him.&nbsp; When he had finished, he sat watching the other people
dining, and smoking his cigarette.&nbsp; As he was sitting thus, 
a very tall man, an officer in the uniform of the Guards, came 
in, and, walking straight to the prince&rsquo;s table, said: 
&ldquo;Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of 
fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the 
prince&rsquo;s lap, as if he did not see him at all.&nbsp; He was
a heavy man, and the prince, enraged at the insult, pushed him 
away and jumped to his feet.&nbsp; As he did so, <i>his cap 
dropped off</i>.&nbsp; The officer fell on his knees at once, 
crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my prince, pardon!&nbsp; I never saw 
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more than the prince could be expected to 
believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; Count Frederick von Matterhorn,&rdquo; 
he said; &ldquo;you must be intoxicated.&nbsp; Sir! you have 
insulted your prince and your superior officer.&nbsp; Consider 
yourself under arrest!&nbsp; You shall be sent to a prison 
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this, the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in 
the tavern.&nbsp; They all declared that they had not seen the 
prince, nor even had an <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>idea that he was doing them the 
honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town.</p>
<p>More and more offended, and convinced that there was a 
conspiracy to annoy and insult him, the prince shouted for the 
landlord, called for his bill, threw down his three pieces of 
gold without asking for change, and went into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a disgraceful conspiracy,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The king shall answer for this!&nbsp; I shall write to the
newspapers at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people 
hustled him in the street.&nbsp; They ran against him exactly as 
if they did not see him, and then staggered back in the greatest 
surprise, looking in every direction for the person they had 
jostled.&nbsp; In one of these encounters, the prince pushed so 
hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down.&nbsp; As
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>he was usually most kind and polite, he pulled off his 
cap to beg her pardon, when, behold, the beggar woman gave one 
dreadful scream, and fainted!&nbsp; A crowd was collecting, and 
the prince, forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in 
the tavern, pulled out his purse.&nbsp; Then he remembered what 
he had done, and expected to find it empty; but, lo, there were 
three pieces of gold in it!&nbsp; Overcome with surprise, he 
thrust the money into the woman&rsquo;s hand, and put on his cap 
again.&nbsp; In a moment the crowd, which had been staring at 
him, rushed away in every direction, with cries of terror, 
declaring that there was a magician in the town, and a fellow who
could appear and disappear at pleasure!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p42b.jpg">
<img alt="The crowd running" src="images/p42s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>By this time, you or I, or anyone who was not so extremely 
clever as Prince Prigio, would have understood what was the 
matter.&nbsp; He <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>had put on, without knowing it, not 
only the seven-league boots, but the cap of darkness, and had 
taken Fortunatus&rsquo;s purse, which could never be empty, 
however often you took all the money out.&nbsp; All those and 
many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his 
christening, and the prince had found them in the dark 
garret.&nbsp; But the prince was so extremely wise, and learned, 
and scientific, that he did not believe in fairies, nor in fairy 
gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indigestion,&rdquo; he said to himself: 
&ldquo;those sausages were not of the best; and that Burgundy was
extremely strong.&nbsp; Things are not as they appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over 
by a splendid carriage and six, the driver of which never took 
the slightest notice of him.&nbsp; Annoyed at this, the prince 
leaped up behind, threw down the two footmen, <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>who made no 
resistance, and so was carried to the door of a magnificent 
palace.&nbsp; He was determined to challenge the gentleman who 
was in the carriage; but, noticing that he had a very beautiful 
young lady with him, whom he had never seen before, he followed 
them into the house, not wishing to alarm the girl, and meaning 
to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone.</p>
<p>A great ball was going on; but, as usual, nobody took any 
notice of the prince.&nbsp; He walked among the guests, being 
careful not to jostle them, and listening to their 
conversation.</p>
<p>It was all about himself!&nbsp; Everyone had heard of his 
disgrace, and almost everyone cried &ldquo;Serve him 
right!&rdquo;&nbsp; They said that the airs he gave himself were 
quite unendurable&mdash;that nothing was more rude than to be 
always in the <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>right&mdash;that cleverness might be 
carried far too far&mdash;that it was better even to be born 
stupid (&ldquo;Like the rest of you,&rdquo; thought the prince); 
and, in fact, nobody had a good word for him.</p>
<p>Yes, one had!&nbsp; It was the pretty lady of the 
carriage.&nbsp; I never could tell you how pretty she was.&nbsp; 
She was tall, with cheeks like white roses blushing: she had dark
hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face was the kindest
in the world!&nbsp; The prince first thought how nice and good 
she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked.&nbsp; 
<i>She</i> stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would 
speak ill of him.&nbsp; She had never seen the prince, for she 
was but newly come to Pantouflia; but she declared that it was 
his <i>misfortune</i>, not his fault, to be so clever.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And, then, think how hard they made him work at 
school!&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; said this kind <!-- page 47--><a 
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>young lady, 
&ldquo;I hear he is extremely handsome, and very brave; and he 
has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor boy, 
and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy 
passed first in <i>everything</i>.&nbsp; And now he is Minister 
for Education, though he can&rsquo;t do a line of Greek 
prose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince blushed at this, for he knew his conduct had not 
been honourable.&nbsp; But he at once fell over head and ears in 
love with the young lady, a thing he had never done in his life 
before, because&mdash;he said&mdash;&ldquo;women were so 
stupid!&rdquo;&nbsp; You see he was so clever!</p>
<p>Now, at this very moment&mdash;when the prince, all of a 
sudden, was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest 
officer in the room&mdash;an extraordinary thing happened!&nbsp; 
Something seemed to give a whirr! in his brain, and in one 
instant <i>he knew all about it</i>!&nbsp; He believed <!-- page 
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>in 
fairies and fairy gifts, and understood that his cap was the cap 
of darkness, and his shoes the seven-league boots, and his purse 
the purse of Fortunatus!&nbsp; He had read about those things in 
historical books: but now he believed in them.</p>
<h2><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><i>The Prince Falls in Love</i>.</p>
<p>He understood all this, and burst out laughing, which nearly 
frightened an old lady near him out of her wits.&nbsp; Ah! how he
wished he was only in evening dress, that he might dance with the
charming young lady.&nbsp; But there he was, dressed just as if 
he were going out to hunt, if anyone could have seen him.&nbsp; 
So, even if he took off his cap of darkness, and became visible, 
he was no figure for a ball.&nbsp; Once he would not have cared, 
but now he cared very much indeed.</p>
<p>But the prince was not clever for nothing.&nbsp; <!-- page 
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>He 
thought for a moment, then went out of the room, and, in three 
steps of the seven-league boots, was at his empty, dark, cold 
palace again.&nbsp; He struck a light with a flint and steel, lit
a torch, and ran upstairs to the garret.&nbsp; The flaring light 
of the torch fell on the pile of &ldquo;rubbish,&rdquo; as the 
queen would have called it, which he turned over with eager 
hands.&nbsp; Was there&mdash;yes, there <i>was</i> another 
cap!&nbsp; There it lay, a handsome green one with a red 
feather.&nbsp; The prince pulled off the cap of darkness, put on 
the other, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I wish I were dressed in my best suit of white and 
gold</i>, <i>with the royal Pantouflia diamonds</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one moment there he was in white and gold, the greatest and
most magnificent dandy in the whole world, and the handsomest 
man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about my boots, I wonder,&rdquo; said <!-- page 
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the 
prince; for his seven-league boots were stout riding-boots, not 
good to dance in, whereas <i>now</i> he was in elegant shoes of 
silk and gold.</p>
<p>He threw down the wishing cap, put on the other&mdash;the cap 
of darkness&mdash;and made three strides in the direction of 
Gluckstein.&nbsp; But he was only three steps nearer it than he 
had been, and the seven-league boots were standing beside him on 
the floor!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;no man can be in two
different pairs of boots at one and the same time!&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s mathematics!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then hunted about in the lumber-room again till he found a 
small, shabby, old Persian carpet, the size of a hearthrug.&nbsp;
He went to his own room, took a portmanteau in his hand, sat down
on the carpet, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were in Gluckstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>In a moment there he found himself; for this was that 
famous carpet which Prince Hussein bought long ago, in the market
at Bisnagar, and which the fairies had brought, with the other 
presents, to the christening of Prince Prigio.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p52.jpg">
<img alt="The Prince on the carpet" src="images/p52.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>When he arrived at the house where the ball was going on, he 
put the magical carpet in the portmanteau, and left it in the 
cloak-room, receiving a numbered ticket in exchange.&nbsp; Then 
he marched in all his glory (and, of course, without the cap of 
darkness) into the room where they were dancing.&nbsp; Everybody 
made place for him, bowing down to the ground, and the loyal band
struck up <i>The Prince&rsquo;s March</i>!</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 53</span><i>Heaven bless our Prince 
Prigio</i>!<br />
<i>What is there he doesn&rsquo;t know</i>?<br />
<i>Greek</i>, <i>Swiss</i>, <i>German</i> (<i>High and 
Low</i>),<br />
<i>And the names of the mountains in Mexico</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Heaven bless the 
prince</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He used to be very fond of this march, and the 
words&mdash;some people even said he had made them himself.&nbsp;
But now, somehow, he didn&rsquo;t much like it.&nbsp; He went 
straight to the Duke of Stumpfelbahn, the Hereditary Master of 
the Ceremonies, and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young
lady.&nbsp; She was the daughter of the new English Ambassador, 
and her name was Lady Rosalind.&nbsp; But she nearly fainted when
she heard who it was that wished to dance with her, for she was 
not at all particularly clever; and the prince had such a bad 
character for snubbing girls, and asking them difficult 
questions.&nbsp; However, it was impossible to refuse, and so she
danced with the prince, <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and he danced very well.&nbsp; Then 
they sat out in the conservatory, among the flowers, where nobody
came near them; and then they danced again, and then the Prince 
took her down to supper.&nbsp; And all the time he never once 
said, &ldquo;Have you read <i>this</i>?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Have you
read <i>that</i>?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;What! you never heard of 
Alexander the Great?&rdquo; or Julius C&aelig;sar, or Michael 
Angelo, or whoever it might be&mdash;horrid, difficult questions 
he used to ask.&nbsp; That was the way he <i>used</i> to go on: 
but now he only talked to the young lady about <i>herself</i>; 
and she quite left off being shy or frightened, and asked him all
about his own country, and about the Firedrake-shooting, and said
how fond she was of hunting herself.&nbsp; And the prince 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if <i>you</i> wish it, you shall have the horns and
tail of a Firedrake to hang up in your hall, to-morrow 
evening!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>Then she asked if it was not very dangerous work, 
Firedrake hunting; and he said it was nothing, when you knew the 
trick of it: and he asked her if she would but give him a rose 
out of her bouquet; and, in short, he made himself so agreeable 
and <i>unaffected</i>, that she thought him very nice indeed.</p>
<p>For, even a clever person can be nice when he 
likes&mdash;above all, when he is not thinking about 
himself.&nbsp; And now the prince was thinking of nothing in the 
world but the daughter of the English ambassador, and how to 
please her.&nbsp; He got introduced to her father too, and quite 
won his heart; and, at last, he was invited to dine next day at 
the Embassy.</p>
<p>In Pantouflia, it is the custom that a ball must not end while
one of the royal family goes on dancing.&nbsp; <i>This</i> ball 
lasted till the light came in, and the birds were singing out of 
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>doors, and all the mothers present were sound 
asleep.&nbsp; Then nothing would satisfy the prince, but that 
they all should go home singing through the streets; in fact, 
there never had been so merry a dance in all Pantouflia.&nbsp; 
The prince had made a point of dancing with almost every girl 
there: and he had suddenly become the most beloved of the royal 
family.&nbsp; But everything must end at last; and the prince, 
putting on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet, 
flew back to his lonely castle.</p>

<p><i>The Prince is Puzzled</i>.</p>
<p>Prince Prigio did not go to bed.&nbsp; It was bright daylight,
and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as
a present to a pretty lady.&nbsp; He had said it was easy to do 
this; but now, as he sat and thought over it, he did not feel so 
victorious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where is the 
Firedrake?&rdquo;&nbsp; He reflected for a little, and then ran 
upstairs to the garret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>should</i> be here!&rdquo; he cried, tossing the 
fairies&rsquo; gifts about; &ldquo;and, by George, here it 
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, he had found the spyglass of carved <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>ivory which 
Prince Ali, in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, bought in the bazaar in
Schiraz.&nbsp; Now, this glass was made so that, by looking 
through it, you could see anybody or anything you wished, however
far away.&nbsp; Prigio&rsquo;s first idea was to look at his 
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she does not expect to be looked 
at,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;and I 
<i>won&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, he determined
to look at the Firedrake; for, of course, he had no delicacy 
about spying on <i>him</i>, the brute.</p>
<p>The prince clapped the glass to his eye, stared out of window,
and there, sure enough, he saw the Firedrake.&nbsp; He was 
floating about in a sea of molten lava, on the top of a 
volcano.&nbsp; There he was, swimming and diving for pleasure, 
tossing up the flaming waves, and blowing fountains of fire out 
of his nostrils, like a whale spouting!</p>
<p>The prince did not like the looks of him.</p>

<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>&ldquo;With all my cap of darkness, and my shoes of 
swiftness, and my sword of sharpness, I never could get near that
beast,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and if I <i>did</i> stalk him, I 
could not hurt him.&nbsp; Poor little Alphonso! poor Enrico! what
plucky fellows they were!&nbsp; I fancied that there was no such 
thing as a Firedrake: he&rsquo;s not in the Natural History 
books, and I thought the boys <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>were only 
making fun, and would be back soon, safe and sound.&nbsp; How 
horrid being too clever makes one!&nbsp; And now, what <i>am</i> 
I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p60b.jpg">
<img alt="The Remora" src="images/p60s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>What was he to do, indeed?&nbsp; And what would you have 
done?&nbsp; Bring the horns and tail he must, or perish in the 
adventure.&nbsp; Otherwise, how could he meet his 
lady?&mdash;why, she would think him a mere braggart!</p>
<p>The prince sat down, and thought and thought; and the day went
on, and it was now high noon.</p>
<p>At last he jumped up and rushed into the library, a room where
nobody ever went except himself and the queen.&nbsp; There he 
turned the books upside down, in his haste, till he found an old 
one, by a French gentleman, Monsieur Cyrano de Bergerac.&nbsp; It
was an account of a voyage to the moon, in which there is a great
deal of information about matters not generally <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>known; for 
few travellers have been to the moon.&nbsp; In that book, Prince 
Prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered, and 
that would be of use to him.&nbsp; And he <i>did</i>!&nbsp; So 
you see that cleverness, and minding your book, have some 
advantages, after all.&nbsp; For here the prince learned that 
there is a very rare beast, called a Remora, which is at least as
cold as the Firedrake is hot!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;<i>if I can only make 
these two fight</i>, why the Remora may kill the Firedrake, or 
take the heat out of him, at least, so that I may have a 
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he seized the ivory glass, clapped it to his eye, and 
looked for the Remora.&nbsp; Just the tip of his nose, as white 
as snow and as smooth as ice, was sticking out of a chink in a 
frozen mountain, not far from the burning mountain of the 
Firedrake.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; said the prince softly to himself;
and he jumped like mad into the winged shoes of swiftness, stuck 
on the cap of darkness, girdled himself with the sword of 
sharpness, and put a good slice of bread, with some cold tongue, 
in a wallet, which he slung on his back.&nbsp; Never you fight, 
if you can help it, except with plenty of food to keep you going 
and in good heart.&nbsp; Then off he flew, and soon he reached 
the volcano of the Firedrake.</p>

<img alt="Chapter heading picture" src="images/p64.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><i>The Prince and the Firedrake</i>.</p>
<p>It was dreadfully hot, even high up in the air, where the 
prince hung invisible.&nbsp; Great burning stones were tossed up 
by the volcano, and nearly hit him several times.&nbsp; Moreover,
the steam and smoke, and the flames which the Firedrake spouted 
like foam from his nostrils, would have daunted even the bravest 
man.&nbsp; The sides of the hill, too, were covered with the 
blackened ashes of his victims, whom he had roasted when they 
came out to kill him.&nbsp; The garden-engine of poor little 
Alphonso was lying in the valley, all <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>broken and 
useless.&nbsp; But the Firedrake, as happy as a wild duck on a 
lonely loch, was rolling and diving in the liquid flame, all 
red-hot and full of frolic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; shouted the prince.</p>
<p>The Firedrake rose to the surface, his horns as red as a red 
crescent-moon, only bigger, and lashing the fire with his hoofs 
and his blazing tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he said in a hoarse, angry 
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just let me get at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; answered the prince.&nbsp; It was
the first time he had forgotten his grammar, but he was terribly 
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; grunted the beast.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I wish I could see you&rdquo;; and, horrible to relate, he
rose on a pair of wide, flaming wings, and came right at the 
prince, guided by the sound of his voice.</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>Now, the prince had never heard that Firedrakes could 
fly; indeed, he had never believed in them at all, till the night
before.&nbsp; For a moment he was numb with terror; then he flew 
down like a stone to the very bottom of the hill, and 
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; grunted the Firedrake, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
the matter?&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t you give a civil answer to a 
civil question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go back to your hole and swear, on your honour
as a Firedrake, to listen quietly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my sacred word of honour,&rdquo; said the beast, 
casually scorching an eagle that flew by into ashes.&nbsp; The 
cinders fell, jingling and crackling, round the prince in a 
little shower.</p>
<p>Then the Firedrake dived back, with an awful splash of flame, 
and the mountain roared round him.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>The prince now flew high above him, and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message from the Remora.&nbsp; He says you are afraid
to fight him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; grunted the Firedrake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sends you his glove,&rdquo; said Prince Prigio, 
&ldquo;as a challenge to mortal combat, till death do you 
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he dropped his own glove into the fiery lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; yelled the Firedrake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
let me get at him!&rdquo; and he scrambled out, all red-hot as he
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell him you&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; 
said the prince; and with two strides he was over the frozen 
mountain of the Remora.</p>
<h2><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><i>The Prince and the Remora</i>.</p>
<p>If he had been too warm before, the prince was too cold 
now.&nbsp; The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen 
steel, and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy 
beast, which indeed it <i>was</i>.&nbsp; All around were things 
like marble statues of men in armour: they were the dead bodies 
of the knights, horses and all, who had gone out of old to fight 
the Remora, and who had been frosted up by him.&nbsp; The prince 
felt his blood stand still, and he grew faint; but he took <!-- 
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>heart, for there was no time to waste.&nbsp; Yet he 
could nowhere see the Remora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; shouted the prince.</p>
<p>Then, from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth, black 
hill,&mdash;a chink no deeper than that under a door, but a mile 
wide,&mdash;stole out a hideous head!</p>
<p>It was as flat as the head of a skate-fish, it was deathly 
pale, and two chill-blue eyes, dead-coloured like stones, looked 
out of it.</p>
<p>Then there came a whisper, like the breath of the bitter east 
wind on a winter day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, and how can I come to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; said the prince from the top of the 
hill.</p>
<p>Then the flat, white head set itself against the edge of the 
chink from which it had peeped, and slowly, like the movement of 
a sheet of ice, it slipped upwards and curled upwards, and <!-- 
page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>up, and up!&nbsp; There seemed no end to it at all; and 
it moved horribly, without feet, holding on by its own frost to 
the slippery side of the frozen hill.&nbsp; Now all the lower 
part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing 
coiled about it in smooth, flat, shiny coils; and still the head 
was higher than the rest; and still the icy cold came nearer and 
nearer, like Death.</p>
<p>The prince almost fainted: everything seemed to swim; and in 
one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top, 
and the white head would have crawled over him, and the cold 
coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone.&nbsp; 
And still the thing slipped up, from the chink under the 
mountain.</p>
<p>But the prince made a great effort; he moved, and in two steps
he was far away, down in the valley where it was not so very 
cold.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he shouted, as soon as his tongue 
could move within his chattering teeth.</p>
<p>There came a clear, hissing answer, like frozen words dropping
round him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I come down.&nbsp; What do you 
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the white folds began to slide, like melting ice, from 
the black hill.</p>
<p>Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him, and 
colder in front of him.</p>
<p>He looked round, and there were the trees beginning to blacken
in the heat, and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the 
plains; for the Firedrake was coming!</p>
<p>The prince just took time to shout, &ldquo;The Firedrake is 
going to pay you a visit!&rdquo; and then he soared to the top of
a neighbouring hill, and looked on at what followed.</p>
<h2><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><i>The Battle</i>.</p>
<p>It was an awul sight to behold!&nbsp; When the Remora heard 
the name of the Firedrake, his hated enemy, he slipped with 
wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the 
valley.&nbsp; On and on and on he poured over rock and tree, as 
if a frozen river could slide downhill; on and on, till there 
were miles of him stretching along the valley&mdash;miles of the 
smooth-ribbed, icy creature, crawling and slipping 
forwards.&nbsp; The green trees dropped their leaves as he 
advanced; the birds fell down dead from the sky, slain by his 
frosty breath!&nbsp; But, fast as the Remora stole forward, the 
Firedrake came quicker yet, flying and <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>clashing his 
fiery wings.&nbsp; At last they were within striking distance; 
and the Firedrake, stooping from the air, dashed with his burning
horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora.</p>
<p>Then there rose a steam so dreadful, such a white yet fiery 
vapour of heat, that no one who had not the prince&rsquo;s magic 
glass could have seen what happened.&nbsp; With horrible grunts 
and roars the Firedrake tried to burn his way right through the 
flat body of the Remora, and to chase him to his cleft in the 
rock.&nbsp; But the Remora, hissing terribly, and visibly melting
away in places, yet held his ground; and the prince could see his
cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the 
Firedrake&mdash;up and up, till they reached his knees, and the 
great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the 
pain.&nbsp; Then up the Firedrake leaped, and <!-- page 74--><a 
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>hovering on 
his fiery wings, he lighted in the midst of the Remora&rsquo;s 
back, and dashed into it with his horns.&nbsp; But the flat, 
cruel head writhed backwards, and, slowly bending over on itself,
the wounded Remora slid greedily to fasten again on the limbs of 
the Firedrake.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the prince, safe on his hill, was lunching on the 
loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Remora!&nbsp; Go it, Firedrake! you&rsquo;re 
gaining.&nbsp; Give it him, Remora!&rdquo; he shouted in the 
wildest excitement.</p>
<p>Nobody had ever seen such a battle; he had it all to himself, 
and he never enjoyed anything more.&nbsp; He hated the Remora so 
much, that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it; for the 
Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair.&nbsp; Still, he
was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was
now <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>slowly coiling backwards, backwards, into the cleft 
below the hill; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had 
suffered.&nbsp; But the Firedrake, too, was in an unhappy way; 
for his legs were now cold and black, his horns were black also, 
though his body, especially near the heart, glowed still like 
red-hot iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Remora!&rdquo; cried the prince: &ldquo;his legs
are giving way; he&rsquo;s groggy on his pins!&nbsp; One more 
effort, and he won&rsquo;t be able to move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by this advice, the white, slippery Remora streamed
out of his cavern again, more and more of him uncoiling, as if 
the mountain were quite full of him.&nbsp; He had lost strength, 
no doubt: for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds, and 
the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter; but so did the roars
of the Firedrake.&nbsp; Presently they sounded more <!-- page 
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>like 
groans; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the 
knees, and fastened on his very heart of fire.&nbsp; Then the 
Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull, knee-deep in snow; 
and still the Remora climbed and climbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it now, Firedrake!&rdquo; shouted the prince; for he
knew that if the Remora won, it would be too cold for him to draw
near the place, and cut off the Firedrake&rsquo;s head and 
tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Drake! he&rsquo;s slackening!&rdquo; cried the 
prince again; and the brave Firedrake made one last furious 
effort, and rising on his wings, dropped just on the spine of his
enemy.</p>
<p>The wounded Remora curled back his head again on himself, and 
again crawled, steaming terribly, towards his enemy.&nbsp; But 
the struggle was too much for the gallant Remora.&nbsp; The flat,
cruel head moved slower; the steam from his thousand wounds grew 
fiercer; and he gently <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>breathed his last just as the 
Firedrake, too, fell over and lay exhausted.&nbsp; With one final
roar, like the breath of a thousand furnaces, the Firedrake 
expired.</p>
<p>The prince, watching from the hill-top, could scarcely believe
that these two <i>awful scourges of Nature</i>, which had so long
devastated his country, were actually dead.&nbsp; But when he had
looked on for half-an-hour, and only a river ran where the Remora
had been, while the body of the Firedrake lay stark and cold, he 
hurried to the spot.</p>
<p>Drawing the sword of sharpness, he hacked off, at two blows, 
the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake.&nbsp; They were a 
weary weight to carry; but in a few strides of the shoes of 
swiftness he was at his castle, where he threw down his burden, 
and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>But the castle clock struck half-past seven; dinner was 
at eight, and the poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the 
garret.&nbsp; Here he put on the wishing-cap; wished for a pint 
of champagne, a hot bath, and his best black velvet and diamond 
suit.&nbsp; In a moment these were provided; he bathed, dressed, 
drank a glass of wine, packed up the head and tail of the 
Firedrake, sat down on the flying carpet, and knocked at the door
of the English ambassador as the clocks were striking eight in 
Gluckstein.</p>
<p><i>Punctuality is the politeness of princes</i>! and a prince 
<i>is</i> polite, when he is in love!</p>
<p>The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led 
into the hall, where <i>several</i> butlers met him, and he laid 
the mortal remains of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying
carpet.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>Then he was led upstairs; and he made his bow to the 
pretty lady, who, of course, made him a magnificent 
courtesy.&nbsp; She seemed prettier and kinder than ever.&nbsp; 
The prince was so happy, that he never noticed how something went
wrong about the dinner.&nbsp; The ambassador looked about, and 
seemed to miss someone, and spoke in a low voice to one of the 
servants, who answered also in a low voice, and what he said 
seemed to displease the ambassador.&nbsp; But the prince was so 
busy in talking to his lady, and in eating his dinner too, that 
he never observed anything unusual.&nbsp; He had <i>never</i> 
been at such a pleasant dinner!</p>
<h2><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><i>A Terrible Misfortune</i>.</p>
<p>When the ladies left, and the prince and the other gentlemen 
were alone, the ambassador appeared more gloomy than ever.&nbsp; 
At last he took the prince into a corner, on pretence of showing 
him a rare statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your royal highness not know,&rdquo; he asked, 
&ldquo;that you are in considerable danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still?&rdquo; said the prince, thinking of the 
Firedrake.</p>
<p>The ambassador did not know what he meant, for <i>he</i> had 
never heard of the fight, but he answered gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never more than now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

been posted all about the town.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p82.jpg">

<p>Here is the first:</p>
<blockquote><p>TO ALL LOYAL SUBJECTS.</p>
<p><i>Whereas</i>,</p>
<p>Our eldest son, Prince Prigio, hath of late been guilty of 
several high crimes and misdemeanours.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>First: By abandoning the post of danger against the 
Firedrake, whereby our beloved sons, Prince Alphonso and Prince 
Enrico, have perished, and been overdone by that monster.</p>
<p>Secondly: By attending an unseemly revel in the town of 
Gluckstein, where he brawled in the streets.</p>
<p>Thirdly: By trying to seduce away the hearts of our loyal 
subjects in that city, and to blow up a party against our crown 
and our peace.</p>
<p><i>This is to give warning</i>,</p>
<p>That whoever consorts with, comforts, aids, or abets the said 
Prince Prigio, is thereby a partner in his treason; and</p>
<p>That a reward of <span class="smcap">Five Thousand 
Purses</span> will be given to whomsoever brings the said prince,
alive, to our Castle of Falkenstein.</p>

<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

<span class="smcap">the firedrake</span>.</p>
<p><i>Whereas</i>,</p>
<p>Our dominions have lately been devastated by a Firedrake (the 
<i>Salamander Furiosus</i> of Buffon);</p>
<p><i>This is to advise all</i>,</p>
<p>That whosoever brings the horns and tail of the said Firedrake
to our Castle of Falkenstein, shall receive <span 
class="smcap">Five Thousand Purses</span>, the position of Crown 
Prince, with the usual perquisites, and the hand of the 
king&rsquo;s niece, the Lady Molinda.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Grognio

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;I did not 
think his majesty wrote so well;&rdquo; and he would have 
<i>liked</i> to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might join 
the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said the ambassador, &ldquo;the 
streets are lined with soldiers; and I know not how <!-- page 
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>you 
have escaped them.&nbsp; <i>Here</i>, under my roof, you are safe
for the moment; but a prolonged stay&mdash;excuse my 
inhospitality&mdash;could not but strain the harmonious relations
which prevail between the Government of Pantouflia and that which
I have the honour to represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to fight; and no more, I think, do 
you,&rdquo; said the prince, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how does your royal highness mean to treat the 
proclamations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, by winning these ten thousand purses.&nbsp; I can 
tell you &pound;1,000,000 is worth having,&rdquo; said the 
prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deliver up the said prince, 
alive, at Falkenstein this very night; also the horns and tail of
the said Firedrake.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t want to marry my 
Cousin Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I remind your royal highness that Falkenstein is 
three hundred miles away?&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a

head butler, Benson, disappeared from the house before dinner, 
and I fear he went to warn Captain Kopzoffski that you are 
<i>here</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;but, my
dear Lord Kelso, may I not have the pleasure of presenting Lady 
Rosalind with a little gift, a Philippine which I lost to her 
last night, merely the head and tail of a Firedrake which I 
stalked this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ambassador was so astonished that he ran straight 
upstairs, forgetting his manners, and crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda!&nbsp; Linda! come down at once; here&rsquo;s a 
surprise for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Rosalind came sweeping down, with a smile on her kind 
face.&nbsp; <i>She</i> guessed what it was, though the prince had
said nothing about it at dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way, your royal highness!&rdquo; cried <!-- 
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>the ambassador; and the prince, offering Lady Rosalind 
his arm, went out into the hall, where he saw neither his carpet 
nor the horns and tail of the Firedrake!</p>
<p>He turned quite pale, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly ask the servants where the little 
Persian prayer-rug and the parcel which I brought with me have 
been placed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Kelso rang the bell, and in came all the servants, with 
William, the under-butler, at their head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;where have 
you put his royal highness&rsquo;s parcel and his 
carpet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, your lordship,&rdquo; said William, &ldquo;we 
think Benson have took them away with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is Benson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, your lordship.&nbsp; We think he 
have been come for!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>&ldquo;Come for&mdash;by whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>William stammered, and seemed at a loss for a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! answer! what do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>William said at last, rather as if he were making a 
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your royaliness, and my lords and ladies, it was like 
this.&nbsp; His royaliness comed in with a rug over his arm, and 
summat under it.&nbsp; And he lays it down on that there seat, 
and Thomas shows him into the droring-room.&nbsp; Then Benson 
says: &lsquo;Dinner&rsquo;ll be ready in five minutes; how tired 
I do feel!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he takes the libbuty of sitting 
hisself down on his royaliness&rsquo;s rug, and he says, asking 
your pardon, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had about enough of service 
here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m about tired, and I thinks of bettering 
myself.&nbsp; I wish I was at the king&rsquo;s court, and 
butler.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>But before the words was out of his 
mouth, off he flies like a shot through the open door, and his 
royaliness&rsquo;s parcel with him.&nbsp; I run to the door, and 
there he was, flying right hover the town, in a northerly 
direction.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s all I know; for I would not 
tell a lie, not if it was never so.&nbsp; And me, and 
Thomas&mdash;as didn&rsquo;t see <!-- page 90--><a 
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>it,&mdash;and
cook, we thinks as how Benson was come for.&nbsp; And cook says

ill-conditioneder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Surprises</i>.</p>
<p>The prince said nothing, the ambassador said nothing, Lady 
Rosalind said never a word till they were in the 
drawing-room.&nbsp; It was a lovely warm evening, and the French 
windows were wide open on the balcony, which looked over the town
and away north to the hills.&nbsp; Below them flowed the clear, 
green water of the Gluckthal.&nbsp; And still nobody said a 
word.</p>
<p>At last the prince spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very strange story, Lord Kelso!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, sir!&rdquo; said the ambassador.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>&ldquo;But true,&rdquo; added the prince; &ldquo;at 
least, there is no reason in the nature of things why it 
shouldn&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe, sir, that the conduct of Benson, 
whom I always found a most respectable man, 
deserved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he should be &lsquo;come for,&rsquo;&rdquo; said 
the prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no; it was a mere accident, and 
might have happened to any of us who chanced to sit down on my 
carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the prince told them, shortly, all about it: how the 
carpet was one of a number of fairy properties, which had been 
given him at his christening; and how so long a time had gone by 
before he discovered them; and how, probably, the carpet had 
carried the butler where he had said he wanted to go, 
namely&mdash;to the king&rsquo;s Court at Falkenstein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not matter so much,&rdquo; added the <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>prince, &ldquo;only I had relied on making my peace with
his majesty, my father, by aid of those horns and that 
tail.&nbsp; He was set on getting them; and if the Lady Rosalind 
had not expressed a wish for them, they would to-day have been in
his possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, you honour us too highly,&rdquo; murmured Lady
Rosalind; and the prince blushed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&nbsp; Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, of course, the ambassador became quite certain that his 
daughter was admired by the crown prince, who was on bad terms 
with the king of the country; and a more uncomfortable position 
for an ambassador&mdash;however, they are used to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth am I to do with the young man?&rdquo; he 
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t stay here for <!-- page 
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>ever;
and without his carpet he can&rsquo;t get away, for the soldiers 
have orders to seize him as soon as he appears in the 
street.&nbsp; And in the meantime Benson will be pretending that 
<i>he</i> killed the Firedrake&mdash;for he must have got to 
Falkenstein by now,&mdash;and they will be for marrying him to 
the king&rsquo;s niece, and making my butler crown prince to the 
kingdom of Pantouflia!&nbsp; It is dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all this time the prince was on the balcony, telling Lady 
Rosalind all about how he got the Firedrake done for, in the most
modest way; for, as he said: &ldquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t kill 
him: and it is really the Remora, poor fellow, who should marry 
Molly; but he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this very moment there was a <i>whizz</i> in the air: 
something shot past them, and, through the open window, the king,
the <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>queen, Benson, and the mortal remains of the Firedrake 
were shot into the ambassador&rsquo;s drawing-room!</p>

<p><i>The King Explains</i>.</p>
<p>The first who recovered his voice and presence of mind was 
Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your lordship ring for coffee?&rdquo; he asked, 
quietly; and when he was told &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he bowed and 
withdrew, with majestic composure.</p>
<p>When he had gone, the prince threw himself at the king&rsquo;s
feet, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, pardon, my liege!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me, sir!&rdquo; answered the king,
very angrily; and the poor prince threw himself at the feet of 
the queen.</p>
<p>But she took no notice of him whatever, no <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>more than if 
he had been a fairy; and the prince heard her murmur, as she 
pinched her royal arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall waken presently; this is nothing out of the way
for a dream.&nbsp; Dr. Rumpfino ascribes it to imperfect 
nutrition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time, the Lady Rosalind, as pale as a marble statue, 
was leaning against the side of the open window.&nbsp; The prince
thought he could do nothing wiser than go and comfort her, so he 
induced her to sit down on a chair in the balcony,&mdash;for he 
felt that he was not wanted in the drawing-room;&mdash;and soon 
they were talking happily about the stars, which had begun to 
appear in the summer night.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ambassador had induced the king to take a seat;
but there was no use in talking to the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a miracle,&rdquo; she said to herself, <!--
page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>&ldquo;and miracles do not happen; therefore this has 
not happened.&nbsp; Presently, I shall wake up in my own bed at 
Falkenstein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Benson, William, and Thomas brought in the coffee, but 
the queen took no notice.&nbsp; When they went away, the rest of 
the company slipped off quietly, and the king was left alone with
the ambassador; for the queen could hardly be said to count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to know all about it, I suppose?&rdquo; said 
his majesty, in a sulky voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you have a 
right to it, and I shall tell you.&nbsp; We were just sitting 
down to dinner at Falkenstein, rather late,&mdash;hours get later
every year, I think&mdash;when I heard a row in the premises, and
the captain of the guard, Colonel McDougal, came and told us that
a man had arrived with the horns and tail of the Firedrake, and 
was claiming the reward.&nbsp; Her majesty and I rose and <!-- 
page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>went into the outer court, where we found, sitting on 
that carpet with a glass of beer in his hand, a 
respectable-looking upper servant, whom I recognised as your 
butler.&nbsp; He informed us that he had just killed the beast, 
and showed us the horns and tail, sure enough; there they 
are!&nbsp; The tail is like the iron handle of a pump, but the 
horns are genuine.&nbsp; A pair were thrown up by a volcano, in 
my great-grandfather&rsquo;s time, Giglio I. <a 
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100" 
class="citation">[100]</a>&nbsp; Excellent coffee this, of 
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ambassador bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we asked him <i>where</i> he killed the 
Firedrake, and he said in a garden near Gluckstein.&nbsp; Then he
began to speak about the reward, and the &lsquo;perkisits,&rsquo;
as he called them, which it seems he had read about in my 
proclamation.&nbsp; <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Rather a neat thing; drew it up 
myself,&rdquo; added his majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much to the point,&rdquo; said the ambassador, 
wondering what the king was coming to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like it,&rdquo; said the king, much 
pleased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, where was I?&nbsp; Oh, yes; your man 
said he had killed the creature in a garden, quite near 
Gluckstein.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t much like the whole affair: he 
is an alien, you see; and then there was my niece, 
Molinda&mdash;poor girl, <i>she</i> was certain to give 
trouble.&nbsp; Her heart is buried, if I may say so, with poor 
Alphonso.&nbsp; But the queen is a very remarkable 
woman&mdash;very remarkable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very!&rdquo; said the Ambassador, with perfect 
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Caitiff!&rsquo; she cries to your butler;&rdquo;
his majesty went on, &ldquo;&lsquo;perjured knave, thou liest in 
thy throat!&nbsp; Gluckstein is a hundred leagues <!-- page 
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>from here, and how sayest thou that thou slewest the 
monster, and camest hither in a few hours&rsquo; 
space?&rsquo;&nbsp; This had not occurred to me,&mdash;I am a 
plain king, but I at once saw the force of her majesty&rsquo;s 
argument.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;how did you 
manage it?&rsquo;&nbsp; But he&mdash;your man, I mean&mdash;was 
not a bit put out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, your majesty,&rsquo; says 
he, &lsquo;I just sat down on that there bit of carpet, wished I 
was here, and here <i>I ham</i>.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;d be glad, 
having had the trouble,&mdash;and my time not being my 
own,&mdash;to see the colour of them perkisits, according to the 
proclamation.&rsquo;&nbsp; On this her majesty grew more 
indignant, if possible.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; she cried; 
&lsquo;a story out of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> is not suited for
a modern public, and fails to win &aelig;sthetic 
credence.&rsquo;&nbsp; These were her very words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her majesty&rsquo;s expressions are ever choice and 
appropriate,&rdquo; said the Ambassador.</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sit down there, on the carpet, 
knave,&rsquo; she went on; &lsquo;ourself and 
consort&rsquo;&mdash;meaning <i>me</i>&mdash;&lsquo;will take our
places by thy side, and <i>I</i> shall wish us in Gluckstein, at 
thy master&rsquo;s!&nbsp; When the experiment has failed, thy 
head shall from thy shoulders be shorn!&rsquo;&nbsp; So your man 
merely said, &lsquo;Very well, mum,&mdash;your majesty, I 
mean,&rsquo; and sat down.&nbsp; The queen took her place at the 
edge of the carpet; I sat between her and the butler, and she 
said, &lsquo;I wish we were in Gluckstein!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then we 
rose, flew through the air at an astonishing pace, and here we 
are!&nbsp; So I suppose the rest of the butler&rsquo;s tale is 
true, which I regret; but a king&rsquo;s word is sacred, and he 
shall take the place of that sneak, Prigio.&nbsp; But as we left 
home before dinner, and as <i>yours</i> is over, may I request 
your lordship to believe that I should be delighted to take 
something cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>The ambassador at once ordered a sumptuous collation, 
to which the king did full justice; and his majesty was shown to 
the royal chamber, as he complained of fatigue.&nbsp; The queen 
accompanied him, remarking that she was sound asleep, but would 
waken presently.&nbsp; Neither of them said 
&ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; to the prince.&nbsp; Indeed, they did 
not see him again, for he was on the balcony with Lady 
Rosalind.&nbsp; They found a great deal to say to each other, and
at last the prince asked her to be his wife; and she said that if
the king and her father gave their permission&mdash;why, then she
would!&nbsp; After this she went to bed; and the prince, who had 
not slept at all the night before, felt very sleepy also.&nbsp; 
But he knew that first he had something that must be done.&nbsp; 
So he went into the drawing-room, took his carpet, and wished to 
be&mdash;now, where do you suppose?&nbsp; Beside the dead body 
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>of the Firedrake!&nbsp; There he was in a moment; and 
dreadful the body looked, lying stark and cold in the white 
moonshine.&nbsp; Then the prince cut off its four hoofs, put them
in his wallet, and with these he flew back in a second, and met 
the ambassador just as he came from ushering the king to 
bed.&nbsp; Then the prince was shown his own room, where he 
locked up the hoofs, the carpet, the cap of darkness, and his 
other things in an iron box; and so he went to bed and dreamed of
his Lady Rosalind.</p>

<p><i>The King&rsquo;s Cheque</i>.</p>
<p>When they all wakened next morning, their first ideas were 
confused.&nbsp; It is often confusing to waken in a strange bed, 
much more so when you have flown through the air, like the king, 
the queen, and Benson the butler.&nbsp; For her part, the queen 
was the most perplexed of all; for she did undeniably wake, and 
yet she was not at home, where she had expected to be.&nbsp; 
However, she was a determined woman, and stood to it that nothing
unusual was occurring.&nbsp; The butler made up his mind to claim
the crown princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda; <!-- page 
107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>because, as he justly remarked to William, here was 
such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way
again.&nbsp; As for the king, he was only anxious to get back to 
Falkenstein, and have the whole business settled in a 
constitutional manner.&nbsp; The ambassador was not sorry to get 
rid of the royal party; and it was proposed that they should all 
sit down on the flying carpet, and wish themselves at home 
again.&nbsp; But the queen would not hear of it: she said it was 
childish and impossible; so the carriage was got ready for her, 
and she started without saying a word of good-bye to 
anyone.&nbsp; The king, Benson, and the prince were not so 
particular, and they simply flew back to Falkenstein in the usual
way, arriving there at 11.35&mdash;a week before her majesty.</p>
<p>The king at once held a Court; the horns and tail of the 
monster were exhibited amidst general <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>interest, 
and Benson and the prince were invited to state their claims.</p>
<p>Benson&rsquo;s evidence was taken first.&nbsp; He declined to 
say exactly where or how he killed the Firedrake.&nbsp; There 
might be more of them left, he remarked,&mdash;young ones, that 
would take a lot of killing,&mdash;and he refused to part with 
his secret.&nbsp; Only he claimed the reward, which was offered, 
if you remember, <i>not</i> to the man who killed the beast, but 
to him who brought its horns and tail.&nbsp; This was allowed by 
the lawyers present to be very sound law; and Benson was cheered 
by the courtiers, who decidedly preferred him to Prigio, and who,
besides, thought he was going to be crown prince.&nbsp; As for 
Lady Molinda, she was torn by the most painful feelings; for, 
much as she hated Prigio, she could not bear the idea of marrying
Benson.&nbsp; Yet one or the other choice seemed certain.</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>Unhappy lady!&nbsp; Perhaps no girl was ever more 
strangely beset by misfortune!</p>
<p>Prince Prigio was now called on to speak.&nbsp; He admitted 
that the reward was offered for bringing the horns and tail, not 
for killing the monster.&nbsp; But were the king&rsquo;s 
<i>intentions</i> to go for nothing?&nbsp; When a subject only 
<i>meant</i> well, of course he had to suffer; but when a king 
said one thing, was he not to be supposed to have meant 
another?&nbsp; Any fellow with a waggon could <i>bring</i> the 
horns and tail; the difficult thing was to kill the 
monster.&nbsp; If Benson&rsquo;s claim was allowed, the royal 
prerogative of saying one thing and meaning something else was in
danger.</p>
<p>On hearing this argument, the king so far forgot himself as to
cry, &ldquo;Bravo, well said!&rdquo; and to clap his hands, 
whereon all the courtiers shouted and threw up their hats.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>The prince then said that whoever had killed the 
monster could, of course, tell where to find him, and could bring
his hoofs.&nbsp; He was ready to do this himself.&nbsp; Was Mr. 
Benson equally ready?&nbsp; On this being interpreted to 
him&mdash;for he did not speak Pantouflian&mdash;Benson grew pale
with horror, but fell back on the proclamation.&nbsp; He had 
brought the horns and tail, and so he must have the perquisites, 
and the Lady Molinda!</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s mind was so much confused by this time, that 
he determined to leave it to the Lady Molinda herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of them will you have, my dear?&rdquo; he asked, 
in a kind voice.</p>
<p>But poor Molinda merely cried.&nbsp; Then his majesty was 
almost <i>driven</i> to say that he would give the reward to 
whoever produced the hoofs by that day week.&nbsp; But no sooner 
had he said <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>this than the prince brought them 
out of his wallet, and displayed them in open Court.&nbsp; This 
ended the case; and Benson, after being entertained with sherry 
and sandwiches in the steward&rsquo;s room, was sent back to his 
master.&nbsp; And I regret to say that his temper was not at all 
improved by his failure to better himself.&nbsp; On the contrary,
he was unusually cross and disagreeable for several days; but we 
must, perhaps, make some allowance for his disappointment.</p>
<p>But if Benson was irritated, and suffered from the remarks of 
his fellow-servants, I do not think we can envy Prince 
Prigio.&nbsp; Here he was, restored to his position indeed, but 
by no means to <i>the royal favour</i>.&nbsp; For the king 
disliked him as much as ever, and was as angry as ever about the 
deaths of Enrico and Alphonso.&nbsp; Nay, he was even <i>more</i>
angry; and, perhaps, not without reason.&nbsp; He called up 
Prigio before <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the whole Court, and thereon the 
courtiers cheered like anything, but the king cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&nbsp; McDougal, drag the first man that shouts
to the serpent-house in the zoological gardens, and lock him up 
with the rattlesnakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the courtiers were very quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said the king, as Prigio bowed before 
the throne, &ldquo;you are restored to your position, because I 
cannot break my promise.&nbsp; But your base and malevolent 
nature is even more conspicuously manifest in your selfish 
success than in your previous dastardly contempt of duty.&nbsp; 
Why, confound you!&rdquo; cried the king, dropping the high style
in which he had been speaking, and becoming the <i>father</i>, 
not the <i>monarch</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;why, if you <i>could</i> 
kill the Firedrake, did you let your poor little brothers go and 
be b&mdash;b&mdash;b&mdash;broiled?&nbsp; Eh! what do you <!-- 
page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
113</span>say, you sneak?&nbsp; &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t believe 
there <i>were</i> any Firedrakes?&rsquo;&nbsp; That just comes of
your eternal conceit and arrogance!&nbsp; If you were clever 
enough to kill the creature&mdash;and I admit that&mdash;you were
clever enough to know that what everybody said must be 
true.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have not generally found it 
so?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, you <i>have</i> this time, and let it be a
lesson to you; not that there is much comfort in that, for it is 
not likely you will ever have such another 
chance&rdquo;&mdash;exactly the idea that had occurred to 
Benson.</p>
<p>Here the king wept, among the tears of the lord chief justice,
the poet laureate (who had been awfully frightened when he heard 
of the rattlesnakes), the maids of honour, the chaplain royal, 
and everyone but Colonel McDougal, a Scottish soldier of fortune,
who maintained a military reserve.</p>
<p>When his majesty had recovered, he said to <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Prigio (who
had not been crying, he was too much absorbed):</p>
<p>&ldquo;A king&rsquo;s word is his bond.&nbsp; Bring me a pen, 
somebody, and my cheque-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The royal cheque-book, bound in red morocco, was brought in by
eight pages, with ink and a pen.&nbsp; His majesty then filled up
and signed the following satisfactory document&mdash;(Ah! my 
children, how I wish Mr. Arrowsmith would do as much for 
<i>me</i>!):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said his majesty, crossing his 
cheque and throwing sand over it, for blotting-paper had not yet 
been invented; &ldquo;there, take <i>that</i>, and be off with 
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal 
command, for he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as 
soon as possible, when his majesty yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! here! come back!&nbsp; I forgot something; 
you&rsquo;ve got to marry Molinda!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span

<p><i>A Melancholy Chapter</i>.</p>
<p>The prince had gone some way, when the king called after 
him.&nbsp; How he wished he had the seven-league boots on, or 
that he had the cap of darkness in his pocket!&nbsp; If he had 
been so lucky, he would now have got back to Gluckstein, and 
crossed the border with Lady Rosalind.&nbsp; A million of money 
may not seem much, but a pair of young people who really love 
each other could live happily on less than the cheque he had in 
his pocket.&nbsp; However, the king shouted very loud, as he 
always did when he meant to be obeyed, and the prince sauntered 
slowly back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prigio!&rdquo; said his majesty, &ldquo;where were you 
off to?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember that this is <!-- page 
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>your wedding-day?&nbsp; My proclamation offered, not 
only the money (which you have), but the hand of the Lady 
Molinda, which the Court chaplain will presently make your 
own.&nbsp; I congratulate you, sir; Molinda is a dear 
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the highest affection and esteem for my cousin, 
sir,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry him!&rdquo; cried poor Molinda, 
kneeling at the throne, where her streaming <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>eyes and 
hair made a pretty and touching picture.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; I despise him!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p117.jpg">
<img alt="Molinda before the King" src="images/p117.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to say, sir,&rdquo; the prince went on, 
&ldquo;that I cannot possibly have the pleasure of wedding my 
cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family gibbet, I presume, is in good working 
order?&rdquo; asked the king of the family executioner, a tall 
gaunt man in black and scarlet, who was only employed in the case
of members of the blood royal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never better, sire,&rdquo; said the man, bowing with 
more courtliness than his profession indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;Prince Prigio, 
you have your choice.&nbsp; <i>There</i> is the gallows, 
<i>here</i> is Lady Molinda.&nbsp; My duty is painful, but 
clear.&nbsp; A king&rsquo;s word cannot be broken.&nbsp; Molly, 
or the gibbet!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>The prince bowed respectfully to Lady Molinda:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, my cousin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your clemency 
will excuse my answer, and you will not misinterpret the apparent
discourtesy of my conduct.&nbsp; I am compelled, most 
unwillingly, to slight your charms, and to select the Extreme 
Rigour of the Law.&nbsp; Executioner, lead on!&nbsp; Do your 
duty; for me, <i>Prigio est pr&ecirc;t</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;for this
was his motto, and meant that he was ready.</p>
<p>Poor Lady Molinda could not but be hurt by the prince&rsquo;s 
preference for death over marriage to her, little as she liked 
him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p119.jpg">
<img alt="The family executioner" src="images/p119.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is life, then, so worthless? and is Molinda <!-- page 
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>so
terrible a person that you prefer <i>those</i> arms,&rdquo; and 
she pointed to the gibbet, &ldquo;to 
<i>these</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;here she held out her own, which were 
very white, round and pretty: for Molinda was a good-hearted 
girl, she could not bear to see Prigio put to death; and then, 
perhaps, she reflected that there are worse positions than the 
queenship of Pantouflia.&nbsp; For Alphonso was gone&mdash;crying
would not bring him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Madam!&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;you are 
forgiving&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>you</i> are brave!&rdquo; said Molinda, feeling 
quite a respect for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But neither your heart nor mine is ours to give.&nbsp; 
Since mine was another&rsquo;s, I understand too well the feeling
of <i>yours</i>!&nbsp; Do not let us buy life at the price of 
happiness and honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to the king, the prince said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, is there no way but by death or marriage?&nbsp; 
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>You say you cannot keep half only of your promise; and 
that, if I accept the reward, I must also unite myself with my 
unwilling cousin.&nbsp; Cannot the whole proclamation be 
annulled, and will you consider the bargain void if I tear up 
this flimsy scroll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here the prince fluttered the cheque for &pound;1,000,000 
in the air.</p>
<p>For a moment the king was tempted; but then he said to 
himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it&rsquo;s only an extra penny on the 
income-tax.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;Keep your dross,&rdquo; he 
shouted, meaning the million; &ldquo;but let <i>me</i> keep my 
promise.&nbsp; To chapel at once, or&mdash;&rdquo; and he pointed
to the executioner.&nbsp; &ldquo;The word of a king of Pantouflia
is sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so is that of a crown prince,&rdquo; answered 
Prigio; &ldquo;and <i>mine</i> is pledged to a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall be a mourning bride,&rdquo; cried the <!-- 
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>king savagely, &ldquo;unless&rdquo;&mdash;here he 
paused for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;unless you bring me back 
Alphonso and Enrico, safe and well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince thought for the space of a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept the alternative,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if 
your majesty will grant me my conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name them!&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be transported to Gluckstein, left there 
unguarded, and if, in three days, I do not return with my 
brothers safe and well, your majesty shall be spared a cruel 
duty.&nbsp; Prigio of Pantouflia will perish by his own 
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, whose mind did not work very quickly, took some 
minutes to think over it.&nbsp; Then he saw that by granting the 
prince&rsquo;s conditions, he would either recover his dear sons,
or, at least, get rid of Prigio, without the unpleasantness of 
having him executed.&nbsp; For, <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>though some
kings have put their eldest sons to death, and most have wished 
to do so, they have never been better loved by the people for 
their Roman virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour bright?&rdquo; said the king at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour bright!&rdquo; answered the prince, and, for the
first time in many months, the royal father and son shook 
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, madam,&rdquo; said Prigio in a stately way to 
Lady Molinda, &ldquo;in less than a week I trust we shall be 
taking our vows at the same altar, and that the close of the 
ceremony which finds us cousins will leave us brother and 
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Molinda merely stared; for she could not imagine what he 
meant.&nbsp; In a moment he was gone; and having taken, by the 
king&rsquo;s permission, the flying carpet, he was back at the 
ambassador&rsquo;s house in Gluckstein.</p>
<h2><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p><i>The Black Cat and the Brethren</i>!</p>
<p>Who was glad to see the prince, if it was not Lady 
Rosalind?&nbsp; The white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses
in a moment, and then back to white again, they were so alarmed 
at the change.&nbsp; So the two went into the gardens together, 
and talked about a number of things; but at last the prince told 
her that, before three days were over, all would be well, or all 
would be over with him.&nbsp; For either he would have brought 
his brothers back, sound and well, to Falkenstein, or he would 
not survive his dishonour.</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;It is no more than right,&rdquo; he said; 
&ldquo;for had I gone first, neither of them would have been sent
to meet the monster after I had fallen.&nbsp; And I <i>should</i>
have fallen, dear Rosalind, if I had faced the Firedrake before I
knew <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when she asked him why, and what good she had done him, 
he told her all the story; and how, before he fell in love with 
her, he didn&rsquo;t believe in fairies, or Firedrakes, or caps 
of darkness, or anything nice and impossible, but only in horrid 
useless facts, and chemistry, and geology, and arithmetic, and 
mathematics, and even political economy.&nbsp; And the Firedrake 
would have made a mouthful of him, then.</p>
<p>So she was delighted when she heard this, almost as much 
delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most 
difficult adventure.&nbsp; <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>For it was 
one thing to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake, and quite 
another to find the princes if they were alive, and restore them 
if they were dead!</p>
<p>But the prince said he had his plan, and he stayed that night 
at the ambassador&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Next morning he rose very early,
before anyone else was up, that he might not have to say 
&ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to Lady Rosalind.&nbsp; Then he flew in a 
moment to the old lonely castle, where nobody went for fear of 
ghosts, ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein.</p>
<p>How still it was, how deserted; not a sign of life, and yet 
the prince was looking everywhere <i>for some living 
thing</i>.&nbsp; He hunted the castle through in vain, and then 
went out to the stable-yard; but all the dogs, of course, had 
been taken away, and the farmers had offered homes to the 
poultry.&nbsp; At last, stretched <!-- page 127--><a 
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>at full 
length in a sunny place, the prince found a very old, half-blind,
miserable cat.&nbsp; The poor creature was lean, and its fur had 
fallen off in patches; it could no longer catch birds, nor even 
mice, and there was nobody to give it milk.&nbsp; But cats do not
look far into the future; and this old black cat&mdash;Frank was 
his name&mdash;had got a breakfast somehow, and was happy in the 
sun.&nbsp; The prince stood and looked at him pityingly, and he 
thought that even a sick old cat was, in some ways, happier than 
most men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the prince at last, &ldquo;he could 
not live long anyway, and it must be done.&nbsp; He will feel 
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he drew the sword of sharpness, and with one turn of his 
wrist cut the cat&rsquo;s head clean off.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p128b.jpg">
<img alt="Poor old Frank" src="images/p128s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It did not at once change into a beautiful young <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>lady, as perhaps you expect; no, that was improbable, 
and, as the prince was in love already, would have been vastly 
inconvenient.&nbsp; The dead cat lay there, like any common 
cat.</p>
<p>Then the prince built up a heap of straw, with wood on it, and
there he laid poor puss, and set fire to the pile.&nbsp; Very 
soon there was nothing of old black Frank left but ashes!</p>
<p>Then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard, his heart 
beating loudly with excitement.&nbsp; The sun was shining through
the arrow-shot window, all the yellow motes were dancing in its 
rays.&nbsp; The light fell on the strange heaps of fairy 
things&mdash;talismans and spells.&nbsp; The prince hunted about 
here and there, and at last he discovered six ancient 
water-vessels of black leather, each with a silver plate on it, 
and on the plate letters engraved.&nbsp; <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>This was 
what was written on the plates:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">AQVA. DE. FONTE. LEONVM. <a 
name="citation130"></a><a href="#footnote130" 
class="citation">[130]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; said the prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
thought they were sure to have brought it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took one of the old black-leather bottles, and ran 
downstairs again to the place where he had burned the body of the
poor old sick cat.</p>
<p>He opened the bottle, and poured a few drops of the water on 
the ashes and the dying embers.</p>
<p>Up there sprang a tall, white flame of fire, waving like a 
tongue of light; and forth from the heap jumped the most 
beautiful, strong, funny, black cat that ever was seen!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p130.jpg">
<img alt="The Prince and the bottles" src="images/p130.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>It was Frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth;
and he knew the prince at once, and rubbed himself against him 
and purred.</p>
<p>The prince lifted up Frank and kissed his nose for joy; and a 
bright tear rolled down on Frank&rsquo;s face, and made him rub 
his nose with his paw in the most comical manner.</p>
<p>Then the prince set him down, and he ran round and round after
his tail; and, lastly, cocked his tail up, and marched proudly 
after the prince into the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Frank!&rdquo; said Prince Prigio, &ldquo;no cat 
since the time of Puss in Boots was ever so well taken care of as
you shall be.&nbsp; For, if the fairy water from the Fountain of 
Lions can bring <i>you</i> back to life&mdash;why, there is a 
chance for Alphonso and Enrico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Prigio bustled about, got ready some cold luncheon from 
the store-room, took all his <!-- page 132--><a 
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>fairy 
things that he was likely to need, sat down with them on the 
flying carpet, and wished himself at the mountain of the 
Firedrake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the king now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for if I 
can&rsquo;t find the ashes of my brothers, by Jove!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you know what he meant to do, if he could not find his 
brothers?&nbsp; Let every child guess!</p>
<p>Off he flew; and there he was in a second, just beside poor 
Alphono&rsquo;s garden-engine.&nbsp; Then Prigio, seeing a little
heap of grey ashes beside the engine, watered them with the fairy
water; and up jumped Alphonso, as jolly as ever, his sword in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Prigio!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;are you come 
after the monster too?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been asleep, and I had a 
kind of dream that he beat me.&nbsp; But the pair of us will 
tackle him.&nbsp; How is Molinda?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;Prettier than ever,&rdquo; said Prigio; 
&ldquo;but anxious about you.&nbsp; However, the 
Firedrake&rsquo;s dead and done for; so never mind him.&nbsp; But
I left Enrico somewhere about.&nbsp; Just you sit down and wait a
minute, till I fetch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince said this, because he did not wish Alphonso to know
that he and Enrico had not had quite the best of it in the affair
with the monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; says Alphonso; &ldquo;but
have you any luncheon with you?&nbsp; Never was so hungry in my 
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Prigio had thought of this, and he brought out some 
cold sausage (to which Alphonso was partial) and some bread, with
which the younger prince expressed himself satisfied.&nbsp; Then 
Prigio went up the hill some way, first warning Alphonso 
<i>not</i> to sit on his carpet for fear of <i>accidents</i> like
that which <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>happened to Benson.&nbsp; In a 
hollow of the hill, sure enough there was the sword of Enrico, 
the diamonds of the hilt gleaming in the sun.&nbsp; And there was
a little heap of grey ashes.</p>
<p>The prince poured a few drops of the water from the Fountain 
of Lions on them, and up, of course, jumped Enrico, just as 
Alphonso had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleepy old chap you are, Enrico,&rdquo; said the 
prince; &ldquo;but come on, Alphonso will have finished the grub 
unless we look smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So back they came, in time to get their share of what was 
going; and they drank the Remora&rsquo;s very good health, when 
Prigio told them about the fight.&nbsp; But neither of them ever 
knew that they had been dead and done for; because Prigio 
invented a story that the mountain was enchanted, and that, as 
long as the Firedrake lived, everyone who came there fell 
asleep.&nbsp; He <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>did tell them about the flying 
carpet, however, which of course did not much surprise them, 
because they had read all about it in the <i>Arabian Nights</i> 
and other historical works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll show you fun!&rdquo; said Prigio; 
and he asked them both to take their seats on the carpet, and 
wished to be in the valley of the Remora.</p>
<p>There they were in a moment, among the old knights whom, if 
you remember, the Remora had frozen into stone.&nbsp; There was 
quite a troop of them, in all sorts of armour&mdash;Greek and 
Roman, and Knight Templars like Front de B&oelig;uf and Brian du 
Bois Gilbert&mdash;all the brave warriors that had tried to fight
the Remora since the world began.</p>
<p>Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in 
their caps, and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on 
each frozen <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>knight.&nbsp; And as they did it, lo
and behold! each knight came alive, with his horse, and lifted 
his sword and shouted:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Long live Prince 
Prigio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>in Greek, Latin, Egyptian, French, German, and 
Spanish,&mdash;all of which the prince perfectly understood, and 
spoke like a native.</p>
<p>So he marshalled them in order, and sent them off to ride to 
Falkenstein and cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Prigio is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off they went, the horses&rsquo; hoofs clattering, banners 
flying, sunshine glittering on the spear-points.&nbsp; Off they 
rode to Falkenstein; and when the king saw them come galloping 
in, I can tell you he had no more notion of hanging Prigio.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<h2><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p><i>The Very Last</i>.</p>
<p>The princes returned to Gluckstein on the carpet, and went to 
the best inn, where they dined together and slept.&nbsp; Next 
morning they, and the ambassador, who had been told all the 
story, and Lady Rosalind, floated comfortably on the carpet back 
to Falkenstein, where the king wept like anything on the 
shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico.&nbsp; They could not make out 
why he cried so, nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried; 
but soon they were all laughing and happy again.&nbsp; But 
then&mdash;would you believe he could be so <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
139</span>mean?&mdash;he refused to keep his royal promise, and 
restore Prigio to his crown-princeship!&nbsp; Kings are like 
that.</p>
<p>But Prigio, very quietly asking for the head of the Firedrake,
said he&rsquo;d pour the magic water on <i>that</i>, and bring 
the Firedrake back to life again, unless his majesty behaved 
rightly.&nbsp; This threat properly frightened King Grognio, and 
he apologised.&nbsp; Then the king shook hands with Prigio in 
public, and thanked him, and said he was proud of him.&nbsp; As 
to Lady Rosalind, the old gentleman quite fell in love with her, 
and he sent at once to the Chaplain Royal to get into his 
surplice, and marry all the young people off at once, without 
waiting for wedding-cakes, and milliners, and all the rest of 
it.</p>
<p>Now, just as they were forming a procession to march into 
church, who should appear but the queen!&nbsp; Her majesty had 
been travelling <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>by post all the time, and, luckily, 
had heard of none of the doings since Prigio, Benson, and the 
king left Gluckstein.&nbsp; I say <i>luckily</i> because if she 
<i>had</i> heard of them, she would not have believed a word of 
them.&nbsp; But when she saw Alphonso and Enrico, she was much 
pleased, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p140.jpg">
<img alt="The Queen and her sons" src="images/p140.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Naughty boys!&nbsp; Where have you been hiding?&nbsp; 
The king had some absurd story about your having been killed by a
fabulous monster.&nbsp; Bah! don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>.&nbsp; I 
always said <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>you would come back after a little 
trip&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I, Prigio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, madam,&rdquo; said Prigio; &ldquo;and I said
so, too.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rdquo;&nbsp; And all the 
courtiers cried: &ldquo;Yes, you did;&rdquo; but some added, to 
themselves, &ldquo;<i>He always says</i>, &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I 
say so?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the queen was introduced to Lady Rosalind, and she said 
it was &ldquo;rather a short engagement, but she supposed young 
people understood their own affairs best.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they 
do!&nbsp; So the three pairs were married, with the utmost 
rejoicings; and her majesty never, her whole life long, could be 
got to believe that anything unusual had occurred.</p>
<p>The honeymoon of Prince Prigio and the Crown Princess Rosalind
was passed at the castle, where the prince had been deserted by 
the Court.&nbsp; But now it was delightfully fitted <!-- page 
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>up; and Master Frank marched about the house with his 
tail in the air, as if the place belonged to him.</p>
<p>Now, on the second day of their honeymoon, the prince and 
princess were sitting in the garden together, and the prince 
said, &ldquo;Are you <i>quite</i> happy, my dear?&rdquo; and 
Rosalind said, &ldquo;Yes; <i>quite</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the prince did not like the tone of her voice, and he 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s something; do tell me what it 
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rosalind, putting her head on his 
shoulder, and speaking very low, &ldquo;I want everybody to love 
you as much as I do.&nbsp; No, not quite so very much,&mdash;but 
I want them to like you.&nbsp; Now they <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, 
because they are afraid of you; for you are so awfully 
clever.&nbsp; Now, couldn&rsquo;t you take the wishing cap, and 
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
143</span>wish to be no cleverer than other people?&nbsp; Then 
everybody would like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince thought a minute, then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your will is law, my dear; anything to please 
you.&nbsp; Just wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he ran upstairs, for the last time, to the fairy garret, 
and he put on the wishing cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t 
wish <i>that</i>.&nbsp; Every man has one secret from his wife, 
and this shall be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said aloud: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">I wish to SEEM 
no cleverer than other people</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he ran downstairs again, and the princess noticed a great
difference in him (though, of course, there was really none at 
all), and so did everyone.&nbsp; For the prince remained as 
clever as ever he had been; but, as nobody observed it, he became
the most popular prince, <!-- page 144--><a 
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>and finally
the best-beloved king who had ever sat on the throne of 
Pantouflia.</p>
<p>But occasionally Rosalind would say, &ldquo;I do believe, my 
dear, that you are really as clever as ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he <i>was</i>!</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
